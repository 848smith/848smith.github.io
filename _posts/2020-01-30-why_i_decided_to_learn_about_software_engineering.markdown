For my whole life there has really only been one job I have ever want to do. That was be an Air Force Pilot but, that kind of got struck down when I tore my are and my vision is not exactly perfect. Honestly that was the only reason I went to college after high school. When I leanred it could not happen I dropped out and have been trying to search for something that excites me. 

During my time since my first job there are a lot of things I look for in my jobs that I have learned I care for in a company but still had issues on what do I want to do at that dream company. At one of my previous jobs I found out I love working with Excel and Google sheets. My favorite thing was making formulas and learning it on my own. I would deconstruct my co-workers formulas to learn how it worked. Since then I have been wondering how I can turn the skill of decontrucitng and seeing how things work from the ground up into a job.

One of my favorite tv shows actually during this time was Silcion Valley. I enjoyed the comedy but towards the later seasons I started to see all this was done with coding. Now it's a fictional show and Richard was a genius with his algorithm but it itrigued me all the applications one thing could work for. He had his own vision but he could have done anything with it. It also showed me how desired a good coder is and how hard people will want to keep those coders who kick ass. 

After all that I also had wanted to get into school again to not be stuck in customer service my whole life answering phone calls. I researched data science, software engineering and more looking to what suits me the best or excites me. During that research one thing that stood out to me was software enginnering and JavaScript. One thing I learned is that even when it was created it was never really used cause people did not know what it could do and the potential. After learning how Google Earth and Google maps kind of brought what it can do to light it exploded and you see it in almost everything. Making apps, learning how Javascript works and coding really actually was what I looked up all day. It was the first time I enjoyed "schoolwork" or researching in awhile. Doing this school work so far some things have stumped me but I enjoy the labs I do making things work and seeing them pass. I enjoy school for once.
