This last week has been crunch time for creating and finishing my rails project. This is my first rails application I have made from scratch and I am very proud of what I have been able to make so far. One thing I need to learn more of is HTML and CSS cause the creativity of making the application look good is where I am lacking. I was able to make 4 models that had associations with each other. 

The main things I had issues with through the whole rails project that is not HTML or CSS was logging out and associations in forms. I was having a issue hooking up the child model with the parent model when you submitted the form. I ended up haveing a hidden field that would be submitted to params. Then in the controller I would have that hidden field be linked up with parent model. That took some time to figure out and get working correctly. I also had issues with logging out as I remember in a lesson that we are not suppose to have a get route for logout. I ended up having to put one in to have it work because there was no way it would work as I spent over 10+ hours researching why it was not working. Doing this project was good because looking up all the issues online I learned a lot more about rails. I was able to learn more about nested resouces and scope methods. 

The most fun I had about this project was being able to see everything hooked up together and working. That is what made me so passionate about coding in the first place. I love buidling models, functions in Excel and electronics to see the final product working so seemless. Seeing a working website work so well that I built is great. Again being able to learn more about CSS and HTML I can make it more user friendly and creative. 

There are some things that I do want to look into more with rails. I think validations are very interesting and I believe I can do a whole lot more with them. One thing I need to practice is putting as much logic as I can out of the controller. My website runs a little slow and I believe I could refactor some code into the models to quicken the thinking of the app. Another important thing I need to work on is forms. Forms are so important to everyday apps and websites. It is hard to name one thing you do enter a field into or search. It is something I believe I can work on a lot more to make my apps function a lot better. Finally, the one thing I did not do with my project but is something almost every single app or site has is a search bar. I did not incorporate a search into mine. This is something that almost literally everything has. It is very important and I need to be able to buidl that out at anytime.

It is safe to say that rails is definitely magical and easy to see why it is so much better than Sinatra in most cases. Of course Sinata is important too and has it's upsides but rails helps build things out a lot easier.
