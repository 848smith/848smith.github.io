Ruby has been a fun tool to learn so far. You can do so much with something so simple! I am still waiting and learning on how to turn something like that into an application for everyday use. I know it will be a huge key and part to making any web page or application. 

After learning and starting into SQL it is amazing to see the pieces of a puzzle come together for everything you can do with software. I can already see a Ruby application using the stored object you make from classes you have made and having functionality with them. I mainly think about the tic tac toe game where you can store the winner of each game in the SQL and use the functions with SQL to get data and trends on who is the best at tic tac toe. SQL has been probably one of the easier things to understand so far since before I started this program I was fairly good with Excel. SQL seems like Excel but way more in depth and useful for everyday life. I say more useful in everyday life because right now we use applications that almost all use SQL's but not everyday do we use Excel.

One thing I did find intriguing about SQL is how you can almost right in sentences to have the functionality work. In Ruby it had a little bit of that feel but there were more symbols and keys to say what you need done. For example SQL statements run like "SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age". If I wanted to verbally tell some to do this I would say "Select everything from the cats table and order them by age from yougest to oldest. The SQL statement is just taking excess words out and saying that exact same thing with only one symbol. You can almost say the statements out loud and get them to work. I always thought that was cool with Ruby and how it would say "@all.each do |cat| cat.name end". Here you are saying "for each object in the instance variable all give me the name function of that object. It obviosuly does not look exactly the same but first seeing .select literally select each object that was true was cool to see. You could think out loud that I need to select something so it is safe to assume or check that there is a select function. Then we go a step further and SQL is almost full sentences on what you want to do.

I absolutely love a challenge which is why I loved Ruby so much and still love SQL. I like it to be hard so I have ot think and problem solve but not be impossible of course. The one thing with SQL and why I find it so interesting is I understand it already but not to the fullest extent so being able to find challenges in something I feel comfortable with is kind of relieving. The one thing with software engineering so far is nothing has been "too easy" or a cake walk. I have had to double check things and look up help to a lot of labs to make sure I get it correct. This has helped me find other things to learn and use in coding.
