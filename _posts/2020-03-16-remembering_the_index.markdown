To me there are many different things that make an array important but the one thing that stands out the most is making sure you remember the that the index starts at 0. 

This may seems simple but if you don't remember that or forget it then when you code and use a 1 instead of a 0 you sometimes don't get errors. Sometimes it works but with the wring data so you think it is going well until you realize it has the wrong information. Since there are no errors you have to dig deep into your code until you realize it was a simple index error. 

There are other important factors like how the shovel "<<" is probably the most used functionality for an array. Arrays can also be used in hashes to make it an even more diverse data set. One thing that is probably the second most important thing is being able iterate over arrays. Doing this can make putting out information so much easier. The main issue though with  this is knowing how to iterate it and remembering what does what. For example trying to know the best uses for .each or .collect. 

To me though the index is the most important because that can be a very useful tool in getting exact data out of an array. Getting the correct data makes or breaks code. The scary part though is this break can be hard to notice in some cases.
